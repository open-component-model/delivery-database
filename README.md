# Delivery-Database

[![REUSE status](https://api.reuse.software/badge/github.com/open-component-model/delivery-database)](https://api.reuse.software/info/github.com/open-component-model/delivery-database)

This repository is used to model the `ocm.software/ocm-gear/delivery-database` component, which contains
a resource referencing the Helm chart used to deploy the persistency layer of the OCM-Gear. As of
now, a PostgreSQL Helm chart is used. However, this is subject to change or to become configurable
in the future.
